# 🌍 Global Health Dashboard (Tableau)

## 🔎 Project Overview
This project explores **global health data** using an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dataset includes key health indicators such as **Life Expectancy, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Cancer Cases, and Population Statistics**.  

The objective was to identify **health trends, demographic patterns, and disease burdens** across countries and continents, while providing interactive visualizations for deeper insights.

## 🛠️ Visualizations Created

### 1️⃣ Map – Total Cancer Cases in Europe
- 🗺️ Highlighted **cancer cases distribution across European countries**.  
- 📊 Helped identify regions with the **highest cancer prevalence**.  

### 2️⃣ Pie Chart – Population by Gender
- 👨‍🦱 vs 👩‍🦱 Displayed the **proportion of male and female population**.  
- 🎯 Easy comparison of gender demographics.  

### 3️⃣ Scatter Plot – Life Expectancy vs BMI
- ⚖️ Explored the relationship between **BMI and life expectancy**.  
- 🔍 Identified **health patterns** based on gender, country, and region.  

### 4️⃣ Trend Line Chart – Life Expectancy Over Time
- 📈 Tracked **life expectancy growth across years**.  
- 🌍 Compared **global vs regional health improvements**.
